## Origin

For years, the video gaming industry has been facing a problem with inclusivity. Female, non-binary, and non-white people are underrepresented and frequently misrepresented on-screen. And even though this category of people make up almost half of video game users, the industry is doing little to change.

Thatâ€™s why we created FormMotion. FormMotion is an endless jumper game that allows users of all ages and drawing abilities to draw and design their own character, platform, and prize in their virtual world. This way, users have the freedom to decide how they want to be represented. Their character can be as realistic or as imaginative as they want it to be. And for users who do not want to draw their own character or props, we have provided inclusive defaults which they can choose from.

We hope that FormMotion can serve as an example for how representative video games could be. 

## How To Play

### 1. Draw your character or choose one from our defaults options.

#### Useful tips:
* Side arrows move you left or right and the up and down arrows can be jump or land.
* Pause the game with the spacebar.
* Collect prizes to increase your current score and avoid the slime!
* When playing on your phone you can tap the screen left & right to move, double tap to jump and pause using the on screen pause button in the top left corner.
